// Scalar values
const answer = 42;
const greeting = 'Hello';

// Arrays and Objects
const numbers = [2, 4, 6];
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

// const is assiged to unique reference and for scalars like int or strig it can't be mutated.
// But in case of object or arrays, reference won't be changed but array or object's value can be altered.
